We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you\u2019ll be in great company.</p>\\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients\u2019 development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>\\n<p><strong>As a Strider, you\u2019ll find a learning opportunity that\u2019s unmatched.

Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\\n<p>You\u2019ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here\u2019s how one day might unfold:</p>\\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I\u2019m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager\u2019s take. We walk away with action items for next week\u2019s one-on-one.</p>\\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I\u2019m at work at the client\u2019s office. They\u2019ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I\u2019m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride\u2019s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I\u2019m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client\u2019s office.</p>\\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we\u2019re retrospecting our last release. I\u2019ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I\u2019ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it\u2019s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It\u2019s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll be doing</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a \u2018teach a team to fish\u2019 mentality to your project.</li>\\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC\u2019s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams.
